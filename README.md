## Steps to create a Gradle project from scratch in LINUX OS

Creating a Gradle project from scratch in Linux involves a few steps. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you get started:

### Step 1: Install Java Development Kit (JDK)
First, ensure you have the JDK installed. You can install it using your package manager. For example, on Ubuntu:

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk
```

Verify the installation:

```sh
java -version
```

### Step 2: Install Gradle
Next, install Gradle. You can download the latest version from the [Gradle website](https://gradle.org/releases/).

Alternatively, you can use the package manager:

```sh
sudo apt install gradle
```

Verify the installation:

```sh
gradle -v
```

### Step 3: Create a New Directory for Your Project
Create a directory for your new project and navigate into it:

```sh
mkdir my-gradle-project
cd my-gradle-project
```

### Step 4: Initialize a Gradle Project
Use the Gradle wrapper to create a new project. This is the recommended way to start a new Gradle project as it will automatically download the correct version of Gradle for you.

```sh
gradle wrapper
```

Initialize a Java project (or any other type you need, like a Kotlin or Groovy project):

```sh
gradle init
```

Follow the prompts to set up your project. For a basic Java project, choose the following options:

- **Select type of project to generate:** `application`
- **Select implementation language:** `Java`
- **Select build script DSL:** `Groovy`
- **Project name:** (press Enter to accept the default or specify a name)

This will create a basic Gradle project structure.

### Step 5: Explore the Project Structure
The generated project structure will look something like this:

```
my-gradle-project/
├── build.gradle
├── gradle/
│   └── wrapper/
├── gradle.properties
├── gradlew
├── gradlew.bat
├── settings.gradle
└── src/
    └── main/
        ├── java/
        │   └── App.java
        └── resources/
```

### Step 6: Build the Project
You can now build your project using Gradle:

```sh
./gradlew build
```

### Step 7: Run the Project
To run the application, use:

```sh
./gradlew run
```

### Step 8: Add Dependencies
To add dependencies, edit the `build.gradle` file. For example, to add JUnit for testing:

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'org.apache.commons:commons-lang3:3.12.0'
    testImplementation 'junit:junit:4.13.2'
}
```

Then, refresh the dependencies:

```sh
./gradlew build
```

### Step 9: Writing Code and Tests
Write your application code in the `src/main/java` directory and your test cases in the `src/test/java` directory.

### Additional Tips
- Use `./gradlew tasks` to list available tasks.
- Use `./gradlew clean` to clean the project.
- Check the [Gradle documentation](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/userguide.html) for more details and advanced configurations.

This should help you get started with a Gradle project from scratch on Linux. Let me know if you need more details or have any questions!
